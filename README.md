# ReadyBetSet

This is a small hobby project to develop a client/server version of the board game [Ready Set Bet](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/351040/ready-set-bet).

I collaborate with Michael Viuff.

We are attempting to apply various principles from Clean Architecture and Domain Driven Development.

The initial version will be a server with JavaFX GUI to display the race. The idea the race is shown on a big screen, and all players watch this.\
Players will connect through a local client to the server (using basic sockets), 
and they will also be able to see the race, as well as place bets.

Eventually we dream of a website optimized for mobile for the players, so they can sit together, watch the race on tv/big-screen, and bet through their mobiles.
